### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in a web browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.\

## Functionalities

Sit in your work chair and by your desk with a web broswer in front of you. The browser may be in laptop, desktop, smartphone or any future device with a supporting GUI.

With Day Planner, at the start of the fine workday-
1. You can add tasks.
2. You can edit tasks.
3. You can remove tasks.

While leaving the work chair and desk to return the next day (Bis morgen!), you may clear your mind as well as the task list for a fresh start next time.
